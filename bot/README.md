# about bot

bot is a bot creator. so it's basicaly a module to create a bot *yo dawg*
reporter for reporting data related to AQI/ISPU in particular area.
those reporter may want to get costumized by their users (for instance the government, or related government \*thing*)

# ispuapi

the bots are useful for reporting the same thing, all day long, tirelessly. not like a human. **cough**


# locations

according to our host (www.bmkg.go.id) it's gathered "data" from locations bellow:

* medan
* pekanbaru
* batam
* jambi
* palembang
* banjarmasin
* palangkaraya
* pontianak
* banjarbaru
* samarinda

# costumizations

#### based on location

some bots may "behave" like
the local people, like accent, or hashtags, knowing that the main
bot is designed for people in Pekanbaru, our hashtags are
alwaysly using the local "value".
next step of our bots is it's should be capable of interact with people like how normal human interact with other normal human.

# howto

* `pip install -e bot`
* ` from `
